    **Lesson Content:**
    ---
    {{{lessonContent}}}
    ---

    **Question Asked:**
    "{{{question}}}"

    **User's Answer:**
    "{{{userAnswer}}}"

    **Your Task:**
    1.  **Analyze the user's answer:** Compare the user's answer to the provided lesson content. Is it accurate? Does it demonstrate understanding?
    2.  **Determine correctness:** Set 'isCorrect' to true if the answer is mostly right, false otherwise.
    3.  **Provide feedback:** Write clear, constructive feedback. If the answer is correct, praise the user and reinforce the key concepts. If it's incorrect, gently explain the misunderstanding and guide them toward the correct answer. Your feedback should be a short paragraph.
    4.  **Assign a score:** Rate the answer on a scale of 0 to 100.

    Evaluate the user's answer now.`,
